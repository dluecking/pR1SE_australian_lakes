### idea
I want to plot for each circular, small plasmid a simple barplot that shows the contig and "from here to here is the core region", "from here to here do we hit other hosts >90pid (subject to change)" and "from here to here is something completely random". We will only consider stripes > 2000 bp (subject to change). 

Lets see how this goes.

In fact: the data is already here:

in "crispr_spacer" we did exactly that: blast the contigs against halos.


Nevermind, its not :-D. I did it via spacer search, not full contig search.
