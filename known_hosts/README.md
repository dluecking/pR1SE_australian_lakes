## Subproject "Known Hosts"
I've identified proteins in nr that are now added to the ORF clusters in "generate_protein_clusters".
In this project I...
1. pull the organism names for each of the proteins in the clusters
2. create a presence / absence plot for each organism 
3. download the organisms with at least 4 different orfs (all of them have ORF6 with the exception of 2)
4.
